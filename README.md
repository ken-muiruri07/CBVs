# CBVs
This project demontrates the use of Django Class-Based Views(CBVs) to perform full CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a model. It's part of my continued learning journey with Django, building on what I have previously done with function-based views and user authentication.

Features:
- Create, List, Detail, Update and Delete views for a model using CBVs.
- Use of TemplateView, ListView, DetailView, CreateView, UpdateView and DeleteView.
- Custom template inheritance.
- Reverse URL lookups and relative URL templates.
